## My process

Hello, this is my 15th challenge here in FEM. This challenge was at level 2 but it is really challenging because there are lots of layout per sections. This challenge can help you as a challenger, to practice reusability and extensible selectors. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- FlexBox
- Grid
- Sass preprocessor

I said that I won't use any frameworks and build it from scratch to be more exciting and challenging

### What I learned

What I learned in this challenge is that, creating extensible and reusable selectors, classes is very important to minimize things up. It is hard to pinpoint sections, but as you go further, it becomes easier than your previous attempt. 

### Continued development

I want to focus more on creating more complex designs and also designing things on my own time
